## About The Project

The University Guide App is a platform that allows users to engage to navigate through the University Campus and also acts as a personalized chatbot. It facilitates speech recognition and text to audio functionality making it completely text-free hence saving time and providing better User Experience. The University Guide App tells direction and also shows direction through map to reach the desired location and can have day-to day conversations with users.

## Features

- Navigation through University Campus
- Personalized Chatbot with day-to-day conversations
- Speech recognition and voice to audio functionality 
- Text-free, clean and intuitive UI for a impressive user experience
- Direction provided through Speech, Text & Maps  

## Tech Stack

- Language: Python
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Version Control: Git

## How To Start
Install the code and install python and click on main.py to run (python version <=3.8)

## Challenges and Solutions

Challenges that I have faced and how i tackled them:

1. Using Python 3.8 along with python 3.11 as libraries used such as chatterbot works only on python version <=3.8 
   - Solution: Created a virtual environment with python 3.8 with global python installed python 3.11

2. Some libraries were Deprecated or didn't work properly such as chatterbot 1.0.8
   - Solution: Solved by installing their previous versions (chatterbot 1.0.0).

3. Handling dynamic User Inputs for desired output location
   - Solution: Solved by creating a score system for each input word & scoring for each output location and displaying maximum scored location.

4. Future Expansion of input & output 
   - Solution: Adding Future locations and increasing conversation data can be easily added by writing clean code with future expansion in knowledge.

4. User Experience
   - Solution: Improved the user experience by providing clean, light, text-free & voice experience.

## Roadmap

- Create an impressive and clean Graphical User Interface 
- Implement functionality that take input and returns desired output
- Add input data and output data 
- Add maps for better User Experience
- Optimize performance and add more features based on user feedback
